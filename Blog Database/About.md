# About

"So you're saying you've already reached the limits of your abilities? Technique, physical fitness, mental strength—none of them are fully developed yet. Do you feel there's an innate, insurmountable gap between you and a genius? That no matter how much effort and hard work you put in, or how well-coordinated your teammates are, it's impossible to bridge that divide. Save those words for after you've exhausted every ounce of effort within you. Rather than stagnating by lamenting how different you are from a genius, believe that your abilities are far greater than this and press forward with single-minded determination, even if the path is arduous."


"Seize the opportunity for your talent to blossom—it might be today. Or perhaps tomorrow, the day after, next year... maybe even after turning 30. I can't say much about physique here, but if you convince yourself you have no talent now… then chances are it will never come."


"Talent can bloom; inspiration can be honed and polished."
The above quotes come from *Haikyuu!!*, spoken about Tooru Oikawa. I often use them to motivate myself.


Currently studying operating systems and cloud-native technologies—still figuring out my future path.


At the same time exploring what’s called love and beauty.
Sharing something I once saw pinned on X:
Love is patient; love is kind.
It does not envy; it does not boast;
it is not proud.
It does not dishonor others;
it is not self-seeking;
it is not easily angered;
it keeps no record of wrongs.
Love does not delight in evil
but rejoices with the truth.
It always protects,
always trusts,
always hopes,
always perseveres.
Love never fails.
– 1 Corinthians 13:4-8


Hoping to become more composed inside.
Working on overcoming my passive mindset.
