# 2025.12.28

On Monday, I was searching for relevant papers on the work I’m currently doing. The more I searched, the more papers I found, and it occurred to me whether I could also publish a review paper along the way. I asked my senior about it, and he said it could be submitted to IJCAI. After organizing the papers, I sent them to him on Tuesday.

On Monday evening, I had dinner with three seniors at Tingyuan Jiangnan Cai in Zhongguancun. Listening to them talk about many academic matters.My senior is not only academically accomplished but also outgoing with high emotional intelligence, making him very adept at social interactions. We ended up chatting until after ten o'clock and then took the subway home together.

On Wednesday, I picked up front-end development again and submitted pull requests (PRs) for Dify and Cherry Studio. My plan is to start small by writing tests and fixing bugs before gradually delving deeper into these projects.

Thursday was Christmas Day. In the morning, my girlfriend and I played a non-horror escape room in Sanlitun (I don’t dare try mildly scary ones anymore—they're such a trap!). Then we went shopping around Guomao Mall where we took some photos together while enjoying desserts and coffee before heading over towards Wangfujing Central Plaza area which had festive decorations set up; there we ate Japanese cuisine later that night meeting up with high school friends visiting an anime goods store ("谷店"). After closing time at mall everyone went singing karaoke for two hours until dispersing around 1 AM – though honestly by then during KTV session energy levels were pretty low... typical low-energy person here!

Saturday noon involved video conferencing with one of those seniors who advised focusing solely coding rather than worrying about writing tasks since likely both survey paper or Infocom poster drafts would be handled by him instead anyway . That evening met university classmates catching each other's updates happily chatting away .

Friday through Saturday mostly consisted submitting PRs toward Dify/Cherry Studio projects as mentioned earlier .
Sunday today spent sprucing personal blog design quite satisfied haha !

Reflecting back this week feels incredibly long even though dining out happened just last Monday seems like ages ago now somehow …
